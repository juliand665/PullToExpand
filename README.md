# PullToExpand

Simple, customizable view that can be expanded by pulling down on it.

***
## Fun Facts

* Uses a UIViewPropertyAnimator with spring timing parameters.
* `@IBDesignable`: fully customizable and previewable in interface builder.
* Also easy to instantiate programmatically.

***
## Preview

This is just one of infinitely many ways to configure it of course.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>compact</td>
		<td>expanded</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="Images/compact.png" alt="Pull-down view in compact (default) mode" /></td>
		<td><img src="Images/expanded.png" alt="Pull-down view in expanded mode" /></td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Installation

Unfortunately, I haven't gotten around to CocoaPods/Carthage support. Just drop the framework `.xcodeproj` into your sidebar and drag the built framework into your target's frameworks section.
